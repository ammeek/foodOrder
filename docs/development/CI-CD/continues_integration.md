# Continues IntegrationÂ§


# Why GitHub actions 
The main reason for choosing github was because of its wide support for GitHub actions and Dependabot. This allow us to automate a lot of the CI/DI and dev ops responsibility's.

# Act
Act will allow us to test github actions locally making it easy to debug and develop our CI infrastructure.

# Dependabot
Keeping on top of the latest security issues for my supply chain is not something I like to do in my free time.
Adding Dependabot means that I won't need to do this while keeping this application secure. 
Coupled with unit and integration testing we almost fully automate our dependency updates with Dependabot.
